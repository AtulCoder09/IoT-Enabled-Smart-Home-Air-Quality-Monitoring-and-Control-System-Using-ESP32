# 🌍 Smart Air Quality Monitoring System (IoT + ESP32)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Smart Air Quality Monitoring System** is an IoT-based embedded solution developed using the ESP32 microcontroller to monitor indoor environmental conditions in real time.  

The system continuously measures gas concentration, dust levels, temperature, and humidity, computes the Air Quality Index (AQI), and automatically activates a ventilation system when pollution levels exceed predefined safety thresholds.  

This project demonstrates practical implementation of IoT, embedded systems, real-time monitoring, and automated environmental control.

## ⚙️ System Working Principle

1. Environmental sensors continuously collect real-time data.
2. ESP32 processes raw sensor readings.
3. AQI is calculated based on pollutant concentration.
4. If AQI exceeds a predefined threshold:
   - Relay module is triggered  
   - Ventilation fan is activated automatically
5. Sensor data and AQI values are displayed on the IoT dashboard.
