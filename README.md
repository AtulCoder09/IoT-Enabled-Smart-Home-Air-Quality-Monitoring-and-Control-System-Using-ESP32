Smart Air Quality Monitoring System (IoT + ESP32)
📌 Overview

An IoT-based embedded system designed to monitor indoor air quality in real time using ESP32. The system measures gas concentration, dust levels, temperature, and humidity, calculates AQI, and automatically controls a ventilation fan when pollution exceeds safe limits.

🛠 Hardware Components

ESP32 (38 Pin)

MQ135 Gas Sensor

Dust Sensor

DHT11 / DHT22

Relay Module

Exhaust Fan

5V Power Supply

⚙️ Working Principle

Sensors collect environmental data.

ESP32 processes sensor readings.

AQI is calculated.

If AQI > Threshold → Fan ON.

Data is displayed on IoT dashboard.

📊 Features
